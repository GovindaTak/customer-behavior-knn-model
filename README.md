# customer-behavior-knn-model
This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict customer behavior based on various features. The dataset used in this project allows us to explore how KNN can classify customers based on patterns and similarities among user data.

# Customer Behavior Prediction with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Project Overview
This repository contains a project that utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict customer behavior. Using a dataset with features like TARGET CLASS etc, the model predicts customer preferences and helps understand customer segmentation based on their behavior.

## Project Details
- **Algorithm Used**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Goal**: Classify customer behavior based on historical data, providing insights for business decisions.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries Required**:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

## Project Structure
- **Data Exploration**: Preliminary data analysis, feature selection, and data cleaning.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of KNN for customer classification.
- **Evaluation**: Model accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.

## Data Summary
